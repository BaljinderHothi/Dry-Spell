Ask any Native New Yorker when the last time we had a dry spell of no water was? 
Many of them cannot even remember it as we are used to it raining so often in NYC.

What inspired this project was the recent fire in Prospect Park in Brooklyn as well as the advisories to preserve water in NYC. This got us thinking, when was the last time it actually rained in NYC?

The last time it rained in NYC was Sept 27....

It has been 43 days and counting of no rain.
         
Not only is this drought causing us to preserve water, but its also causing fires the lower the air quality index.
